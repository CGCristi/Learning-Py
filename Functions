Functions

What are Functions?

Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.
Where a block line is more Python code (even another block), and the block head is of the following format: block_keyword block_name(argument1,argument2, ...) Block keywords you already know are "if", "for", and "while".

Functions in python are defined using the block keyword "def", followed with the function's name as the block's name
How do you call functions in Python?

Simply write the function's name followed by (), placing any required arguments within the brackets.
Add a function named list_benefits() that returns the following list of strings: "More organized code", "More readable code", "Easier code reuse", "Allowing programmers to share and connect code together"

Add a function named build_sentence(info) which receives a single argument containing a string and returns a sentence starting with the given string and ending with the string " is a benefit of functions!"
