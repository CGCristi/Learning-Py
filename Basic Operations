Basic Operators

This section explains how to use basic operators in Python.

Arithmetic Operators

Just as any other programming languages, the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators can be used with numbers

number=1*8+6-2
print("number")

Try to predict what the answer will be. Does python follow order of operations?

Another operator available is the modulo (%) operator, which returns the integer remainder of the division. dividend % divisor = remainder.

test=11 % 3
print("test")
